Above"]},{"metadata":{"id":"na3CAs_noN4c","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["So we ask ourselves' the important questions:\n","\n","*  What are the \"logical\" differences between a Linux file system and the Google File System?\n","*  How do the differences affect our management activities?\n","\n","####  Logical Differences\n","For a Linux file system, the parents keep track of the children.  If you go back to ancient history (aka 1970's and 1980's), the file system was essentially synomymous with the way the files were laid out on the disks.  The \"directory files\" containers held pointers to children containers, and file containers had pointers to the parts of the file.  Symbolic links allowed multiple directories to point to the same file (either directory or file), but everything started at the top and worked its way down.  This had three primary advantages:\n","\n","*  It was \"natural\" for people to understand because it essentially mimiced a room full of file cabinets\n","*  It was \"easy\" to use names (rather than pointers) so people could find files\n","*  It was relatively easy to embed this concept on a tape and on a single disk\n","*  It was easy to continue the original \"unix\" file system which defined as file as a linear stream of bytes\n","\n","On the other hand, starting in the 1980s it had some serious disadvantages:\n","\n","*  The tape/disks became the slow part of the system, so using individual disks for files was a problem (even after caching was used)\n","*  There were a lot of different ways that multiple disks could be used for file systems, for instance:\n","  *  The Thinking Machines file system automatically spread data across all of the drives and mapped physical drives to physical processors\n","  *  The Cray file system \"stripped\" blocks across the drives and relied on the individual applications to \"fix\" the data\n","*  The HDFS file layout wanted to consider data as non-linear, but regular multi-dimensional, so there was some complex algorithms to get data to the right processor.  This file system allows one of the dimensions to be time, so it covers a large number of physical data models.\n","\n","Google's approach may not have been \"explicitly\" defined using the following concepts, but the following appear to be consistent with their model.  In general, the Google model fits the following:\n","\n","*  Users might want worldwide access to the data\n","*  Users should be concerned about data access and data access time rather than a physical layout of the data\n","*  There are so many different applications, that google can't provide the mapping from physical layout to data so the application has to map from the linear stream of bytes to their application needs.\n","*  Users need a way to understand their data layout\n","*  Users need to share documents and/or folders\n","\n","To meet these requirements, Google appears to have made the following decisions:\n","\n","*  They supported the concept of folders rather than directories\n","*  They made each file in their system a stnad-alone entity\n","*  They provide the ability to define the bandwidth requirements for some of their stores and they meet those requirements\n","\n","\n","1.  The implementation is rather elegant, instead of directories containing information about the files/directories under them - the files/folders track the information on their parents.  This makes sense from Google's perspective since they are so good at indexing.\n","2.  They track everything by a fileID and the file carries its 'title' with it.  There is a great deal of information in the metadata for a file, so they use the metadata to keep all of the important information.  (see the example above.)\n","3.  The metadata contains the mimeType so apps that support that mimeType know how to parse the data.  This is important, the data is considered a unicode byte stream and the mimeType tells other apps what they can expect.  \n","\n","There are considerable differences, but it is reasonable to build a small set of tools that wrap around PyDrive to provide a human readable interface to a google drive.  I have instantiated the small set of tools in my bitbucket account so I can use CodeAnywhere for editing.\n","\n","NOTE:  Discussion of the Cloud Storage capabilies (object oriented buckets) will be discussed later in this notebook.\n","\n","All that said, probably the biggest differences are:\n","\n","*  There isn't a concept of the current working directory in Google Drive when working with a notebook.  This would have to be built with a stack that maintains the current working directory if desired.  (this is coming in my ColabGDrive library.)\n","*  You can't \"open\" a file by giving it a path, you have to find the fileID first on your own (the first tool in ColabGDrive library)\n","\n","Overall, I have been able to work with path names (as defined by root oriented strings) fairly well.  The ColabGDrive will eventually have the concept of a current working directory, so it will be relatively easy to map between our visual concept of folders to the GDrive environment.  No we4 problems so far (22 Mar 2018)."]}]}
